# Overview

A basic webform where a user can sign up for the site.

## Components

Will need a webform that validates and logs user details such as a username,
password, e-mail. This information ideally will be able to be edited later down
the line, but for the time being, perhaps the information is just logged in a text
file as a proof of concept. Refer to the assignment instructions for exactly
what level of functionality this might need.
