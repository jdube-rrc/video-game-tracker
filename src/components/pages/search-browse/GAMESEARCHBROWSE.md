# Overview

A page where a user can set search terms, and the app will make an API call to
IGDB based on that criteria. This may be challenging and require a lot of personal
research.

## Components

A search bar that allows for various search parameters. This could include genre,
developer, release year, title, or whatever other parameters we deem relevant that
can be retrieved from the API. There will also need to be a component that receives
the data and populates the page with a grid of matching search results. This is
also a page that would likely benefit from pagination.
