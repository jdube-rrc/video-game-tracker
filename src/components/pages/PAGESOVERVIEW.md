# Overview

These pages are just IDEAS that I think would be somewhat easy and allow us
to properly demonstrate the project requirements for this sprint. If you have
any other ideas, feel free to do those instead, please stick to the file structure
outlined here, and remember that all these pages will need the navbar and the
footer at the very least, we need to be able to navigate between them.

Some pages will be somewhat dependant on other components, services or functionality
existing. In the case of pages that require game cards (most of them) I would just
recommend using the mock data for now, I will be working on the IGDB API implementation
on the side as it is not crucial for our MVP. These can always be refactored later,
and worst case, if we need more data, we can quickly add more mock data to simulate
a larger dataset. Just design like the API is never going to be implemented for now.

# Workflow

I added some readme files to each page with some basic plans for what each page
might need, if I forgot anything, or you have a different vision, no big deal.
