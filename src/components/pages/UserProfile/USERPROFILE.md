# Overview

A page with a basic customizable user profile. This could include a short bio,
the ability to create user-defined lists of favourites. The easiest way to do that
would just allow them to have their all-time favourites on a page, but it could
be fun to allow them to populate the page with lists they define, such as a shortlist,
favourites by genre, etc.

Would just start with all-time favourites only though. This will require the search
service(?) to be finished first.

Other things to include could be a modifiable user profile picture which could
be stored in a database, or you could allow users to simply provide their own image
URLs. Would require extensive validation to not instantly break the page.

## Components

Profile picture component, a favourites grid or carousel of some sort

Also the existing user profile component is a good jumping off point here,
I would start with that.
